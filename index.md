Suez Advanced Water Solutions/Utility Service Company Inc. is a water systems company that provides water services to 7.5 million people in North America. In order to provide quality service, Suez maintains over 6,000 tanks by sandblasting and repainting over 100 water tanks per year. Suez aims to improve their current sandblasting process by utilizing an autonomous sandblasting robot arm to clean the inside surface of the water tanks. In order to use the sandblasting robot arm, Suez requires a platform that remains stable while the arm is sandblasting. Additionally, the platform will need to be both vertically and horizontally mobile so the floor, walls and ceiling of the ground water tank can be sandblasted. 

The engineering team developed 5 preliminary design concepts that would meet Suez’s requirements for their robot arm platform. A rail guided solution, a scissor lift platform solution, an electromagnetic wall climbing solution, a modular scaffolding solution, and an outrigger solution were evaluated to identify the benefits and potential risks of each design. Using an evaluation matrix with ten criteria used to quantitatively asses the designs, the Rail Guided Solution and the Outrigger Solution were selected as the most promising proposals. These solutions were individually analyzed for potential design challenges and performance failures. After redesigning to compensate for potential failures, the final design solution for the robotic sandblasting arm is a triangular platform design that combines the benefits of the Rail Guided Solution and the Outrigger Solution.

The final design solution is a three truss triangular support structure reaching 12 meters in height. The final assembly can be broken down into three main subassemblies: the base, the trusses, and the arm mounting platform. The base assembly consists of three steel plates bolted together to form a triangular foundation. The three trusses are triangular trusses that are available in heights varying from 0.5 meters to 4 meters allowing for the design to be modular. Finally, the arm platform consists of a mounting plate that supports the robot, steel connecting arms that contact the trusses and tensioners with high load rollers that allow for vertical movement. Self-locking, electric wenches, snatch pulleys and cables are used to vertically adjust the height of the arm platform subassembly. The final design is entirely comprised of components that are able to pass through the 24” entry hole and be assembled and disassembled in the water tank.

Hand calculations and finite element analysis were used to verify the performance of the design. Worst case scenario simulations were run on both the trusses and the arm base plate; the safety factors for the trusses and the arm base plate, respectively, were 9.55 and 3.96. Based on the FEA predicted performance, Suez has received a $160,000 innovation grant from their parent company for continued analysis and implementation of the robotic arm platform design. Suez will be constructing a prototype using the Bill of Materials provided by the engineering team and test the prototype with the autonomous sandblasting arm. In conclusion, the final design provides a stable structure for the sandblasting arm, is capable of fitting through the 24” entry hole and is a vertically integrated solution. The robotic arm platform solution will addresses the design requirements and can be successfully implemented.
